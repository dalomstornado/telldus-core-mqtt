**telldus-core-mqtt** is a MQTT broker for telldus-core to integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using their [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

For now sensors, binary sensors, on/off switches and dimmers are supported, see [Known limitations](#Known-limitations) and [Development](#Development) for more information.

## Configuration

It is possible to either use the `config_default.yaml` file or set the config parameters found in the file as environment variables. If the environment variables are not found the values from `config_default.yaml` are used.

### Environment Variables

**`TDM_BASE_TOPIC`**
The MQTT base topic to post to. Default: `homeassistant`

**`TDM_STATE_TOPIC`**
The MQTT state topic to post to. Default: `telldus`

**`TDM_REPEAT_CMD`**
Number of times to repeat all telldus commands since it is not possible to know if the command was received or not. Default: `3`

**`TDM_MQTT_SERVER`**
Hostname or IP address of the MQTT server. Default: `localhost`

**`TDM_MQTT_PORT`**
Port number that the MQTT server is listening on. Default: `1883`

**`TDM_MQTT_USER`**
Username for authentication to MQTT server. Default: `telldus-core-mqtt`

**`TDM_MQTT_PASS`**
Password for authentication to MQTT server. Default: `telldus-core-mqtt`

## Installation

Best option is to run the `docker-compose.yaml` file. Else install it along side `telldus-core` in a python virtual environment, required packages are found in `requirements.txt`.

### Docker Compose

Here is an example using docker-compose.yml:

```
  telldus-core-mqtt:
    image: mliljedahl/telldus-core-mqtt:1.2.1
    container_name: telldus-core-mqtt
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TDM_MQTT_SERVER=localhost
      - TDM_MQTT_USER=telldus-core-mqtt
      - TDM_MQTT_PASS=telldus-core-mqtt
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb:rwm
    volumes:
      - ./tellstick.conf:/etc/tellstick.conf:ro
```

Running docker compose
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker run

```
$ docker run --name telldus-core-mqtt -e TDM_MQTT_SERVER=localhost -e TDM_MQTT_USER=telldus-core-mqtt -e TDM_MQTT_PASS=telldus-core-mqtt -v ./tellstick.conf:/etc/tellstick.conf:ro --device=/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb:rwm -d mliljedahl/telldus-core-mqtt:1.2.1
```

### Python virtual environment

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
$ ./main.py
```

### Linting

See tox.ini for supported environments.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source --no-cache-dir venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
$ tox -e lint
```

## Known limitations

The following are the known limitations.

* To compile telldus-core in alpine linux 3.14 Docker version 20+ is required.
* The only sensors that have been tested are the temperature and humidity sensors and binary sensors. As for devices on/off switches and dimmers have been tested.
* Tested with a TellStick Duo, might also work with the TellStick or other controllers supported by telldus-core.

## Internal tools

Here are a list of tools that can be helpful for creating the telldus.conf file.
### tdevents

Example usage:
```
$ docker exec telldus-core-mqtt tdevents -h
```

### tdcontroller

Example usage:
```
$ docker exec telldus-core-mqtt tdcontroller
```

### tdtool

Example usage:
```
$ docker exec telldus-core-mqtt tdtool -h
```

## Development

For now the only sensors that have been tested are the temperature and humidity sensors and binary sensors. As for devices on/off switches and dimmers have been tested. So there is still much to test and develop in this project. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/mliljedahl/telldus-core-mqtt/issues) or even better, provide a [pull request](https://github.com/mliljedahl/telldus-core-mqtt/pulls).

If you want to provide me with sensors or devices for testing and further development that is also welcome.

### Cloning the repo

To build the Docker image all submodules needs to be fetched as well.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mliljedahl/telldus-core-mqtt.git
$ cd telldus-core-mqtt
$ git submodule update --init
```

### Building the Docker image

```
$ docker build -t telldus-core-mqtt .
```

### Debugging the Docker image

```
$ docker run --rm -v ./tellstick.conf:/etc/tellstick.conf:ro --device=/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb:rwm -it telldus-core-mqtt:latest sh
$ docker logs -f telldus-core-mqtt
```

### Docker Compose

In the `dev` folder there is a development docker-compose file that brings up both mosquitto and home-assistant.
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### MQTT User

To set a password the first time, start the container using the docker-compose.yaml development file and enter the mosquitto container.
```
$ docker exec -it mosquitto sh
$ mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.passwd telldus-core-mqtt
```
